INSTRUCTIONS :

The program is launched from the 'main' file.
It mainly contains 3 'menu' functions, which are themselves the main functions of the program.
You can find these functions in the 'functions.py' file.

The program also contains the following files:
-readers.txt
-books.txt
-booksread.txt
-matrix_note
-similarity.txt
-test.py' (additional file to allow you to test, if you wish, all program functions individually.

The text files are already filled with user data and a list of books.
All of this can, of course, be modified at runtime.

Please note!
It is very important to follow the program's instructions to avoid any problems.
You'll mainly be entering numbers and sometimes character strings.
When it comes to adding these character strings, l'or is a good example:
- adding a book
- adding a nickname
- identification requests
Be careful to avoid any type of ACCENT !!!!!

In the event of a problem, don't panic. Stop the program launch, then restart it.
If the problem persists, contact customer service on: 06 28 77 73 37 or 06 95 24 49 39.
